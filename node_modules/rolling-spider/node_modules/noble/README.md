noble.startScanning(); // any service UUID, no duplicates


noble.startScanning([], true); // any service UUID, allow duplicates


var serviceUUIDs = ["<service UUID 1>", ...]; // default: [] => all
var allowDuplicates = <false|true>; // default: false

noble.startScanning(serviceUUIDs, allowDuplicates); // particular UUID's
```

#### Stop scanning

```javascript
noble.stopScanning();
```

```javascript
peripheral.updateRssi([callback(error, rssi)]);
```

##### Discover services

```javascript
peripheral.discoverServices(); // any service UUID

var serviceUUIDs = ["<service UUID 1>", ...];
peripheral.discoverServices(serviceUUIDs[, callback(error, services)]); // particular UUID's
```

##### Discover all services and characteristics

```javascript
peripheral.discoverAllServicesAndCharacteristics([callback(error, services, characteristics));
```

##### Discover some services and characteristics

```javascript
var serviceUUIDs = ["<service UUID 1>", ...];
var characteristicUUIDs = ["<characteristic UUID 1>", ...];
peripheral.discoverSomeServicesAndCharacteristics(serviceUUIDs, characteristicUUIDs, [callback(error, services, characteristics));
```
#### Service

##### Discover included services

```javascript
service.discoverIncludedServices(); // any service UUID

var serviceUUIDs = ["<service UUID 1>", ...];
service.discoverIncludedServices(serviceUUIDs[, callback(error, includedServiceUuids)]); // particular UUID's
```

##### Discover characteristics

```javascript
service.discoverCharacteristics() // any characteristic UUID

var characteristicUUIDs = ["<characteristic UUID 1>", ...];
service.discoverCharacteristics(characteristicUUIDs[, callback(error, characteristics)]); // particular UUID's
```

#### Characteristic

##### Read

```javascript
characteristic.read([callback(error, data)]);
```

##### Write

```javascript
characteristic.write(data, notify[, callback(error)]); // data is a buffer, notify is true|false
```

##### Broadcast

```javascript
characteristic.broadcast(broadcast[, callback(error)]); // broadcast is true|false
```

##### Notify

```javascript
characteristic.notify(notify[, callback(error)]); // notify is true|false
```

  * use for characteristics with notifiy or indicate properties

##### Discover descriptors

```javascript
characteristic.discoverDescriptors([callback(error, descriptors)]);
```

##### Read value

```javascript
descriptor.readValue([callback(error, data)]);
```

##### Write value

```javascript
descriptor.writeValue(data[, callback(error)]); // data is a buffer
```

#### Handle

##### Read

```javascript
peripheral.readHandle(handle, callback(error, data));
```

##### Write

```javascript
peripheral.writeHandle(handle, data, withoutResponse, callback(error));
```

### Events

#### Adapter state change

```javascript
state = <"unknown" | "resetting" | "unsupported" | "unauthorized" | "poweredOff" | "poweredOn">

noble.on('stateChange', callback(state));
```

#### Scan started:

```javascript
noble.on('scanStart', callback);
```

#### Scan stopped

```javascript
noble.on('scanStop', callback);
```

#### Peripheral discovered:

```javascript
peripheral = {
  uuid: "<uuid>",
  address: "<BT address">, // Bluetooth Address of device, or 'unknown' if not known
  advertisement: {
    localName: "<name>",
    txPowerLevel: <int>,
    serviceUuids: ["<service UUID>", ...],
    manufacturerData: <Buffer>,
    serviceData: [
        {
            uuid: "<service UUID>"
            data: <Buffer>
        },
        ...
    ]
  },
  rssi: <rssi>
};

noble.on('discover', callback(peripheral));
```

#### Peripheral

##### Connected

```javascript
peripheral.on('connect', callback);
```

##### Disconnected:

```javascript
peripheral.on('disconnect', callback);
```

##### RSSI update

```javascript
peripheral.on('rssiUpdate', callback(rssi));
```

##### Services discovered

```javascript
peripheral.on('servicesDiscover', callback(services));
```

#### Service

##### Included services discovered

```javascript
service.on('includedServicesDiscover', callback(includedServiceUuids));
```

##### Characteristics discovered

```javascript
characteristic = {
  uuid: "<uuid>",
   // properties: 'broadcast', 'read', 'writeWithoutResponse', 'write', 'notify', 'indicate', 'authenticatedSignedWrites', 'extendedProperties'
  properties: [...]
};

service.on('characteristicsDiscover', callback(characteristics));
```

#### Characteristic

##### Data

Emitted when characteristic read has completed, result of ```characteristic.read(...)``` or characteristic value has been updated by peripheral via notification or indication.

```javascript
characteristic.on('data', callback(data, isNotification));

characteristic.on('read', callback(data, isNotification)); // legacy
```

##### Write

Emitted when characteristic write has completed, result of ```characteristic.write(...)```.

```javascript
characteristic.on('write', withoutResponse, callback());
```

##### Broadcast

Emitted when characteristic broadcast state changes, result of ```characteristic.broadcast(...)```.

```javascript
characteristic.on('broadcast', callback(state));
```

##### Notify

Emitted when characteristic notification state changes, result of ```characteristic.notify(...)```.

```javascript
characteristic.on('notify', callback(state));
```

##### Descriptors discovered

```javascript
descriptor = {
  uuid: '<uuid>'
};

characteristic.on('descriptorsDiscover', callback(descriptors));
```

#### Descriptor

##### Value read

```javascript
descriptor.on('valueRead', data);
```

##### Value write

```javascript
descriptor.on('valueWrite');
```

## Running on Linux

### Running without root/sudo

Run the following command in the directory you ran ```npm install``` from:

```sh
find -path '*noble*Release/hci-ble' -exec sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip '{}' \;
```

This grants noble's ```hci-ble``` binary ```cap_net_raw``` privileges, so it can start/stop scanning for BLE devices.

__Note:__ The above command requires ```setcap``` to be installed, it can be installed using the following:

 * apt: ```sudo apt-get install libcap2-bin```
 * yum: ```su -c \'yum install libcap2-bin\'```

### Multiple Adapters

```hci0``` is used by default to override set the ```NOBLE_HCI_DEVICE_ID``` environment variable to the interface number.

Example, specify ```hci1```:

```sh
sudo NOBLE_HCI_DEVICE_ID=1 node <your file>.js
```

### Reporting all HCI events

By default noble waits for both the advertisement data and scan response data for each Bluetooth address. If your device does not use scan response the following enviroment variable can be used to bypass it.


```sh
sudo NOBLE_REPORT_ALL_HCI_EVENTS=1 node <your file>.js
```
